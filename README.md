What is spaced repetition?
------------

Spaced repetition is a way of learning through active recall, spread out across multiple study sessions. Put simply, your brain learns best when it is forced to remember the right answer.

 Instead of taking notes, turn that information into flashcards. On one side of the card, you should ask a question or have blank spacesfor information you need to learn. The other side will have an answer, an explanation, or a tutorial; You do not need paper flashcards anymore.
  After youâ€™ve made a few flashcards, test yourself and do this again 2 or 3 days later. If you find yourself forgetting, review more frequently.It really is that simple. Recalling the right answer will be tough the first time but trust that your brain is working hard at retrieval.
